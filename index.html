            I graduated from the University of Dallas where I double majored in Business Leadership and Psychology.  Since graduating, I've worked in Healthcare Consulting
            <br>
            <br>
            I really enjoy the creativity, challenges, and collaboration that comes with coding, so I'm pursuing a full stack web development certification from SMU.            
            Longer term, I hope to use the experience gained through this program as a stepping stone in pursuing a CS Degree focusing on Data Science.

            In my spare time, photography in particular has been a big passion of mine.  
            Although I do some commercial work, my main focus has been landscape photography and natural light portraiture.  
            I also enjoy spending reading, hiking, traveling, and spending time with family.
